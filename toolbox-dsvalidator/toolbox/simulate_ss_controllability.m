% Script developed to simulate the state-space controllability property in counterexamples
% 
% For a LTI system in state-space format, SIMULATE_SS_CONTROLLABILITY(sys)
% decides about the controlability. 
% It returns decision = 1 if the system is controllable, and 
% returns decision = 0 in other case.
