function [output, time_execution] = simulate_cl_stability(plant, controller, bits)
%
% Script developed to simulate the stability property for closed-loop systems in counterexamples
%
% Give the system as a struct with all parameters of counterexample and matlab will check stability property for delta and direct forms.
% 
% Function: [output, time_execution] = simulate_stability(plant, controller, bits)
% plant: the physical plant in transfer-function format
% controller: the digital controller in transfer-function format
% bits: the fractional bits
%
% The output is the feedback returned from simulation;
% The time execution is the time to execute the simulation;
