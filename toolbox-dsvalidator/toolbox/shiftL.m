function [z_out] = shiftL(zIn,z, nZ)
%
% Function developed to shift left during the realizations (DFI,DFII and TDFII)
%
% Function: [z_out] = shiftL(zIn,z, nZ)
%
% The main objective of this function is flip the vector in the right-left
% direction and including a value in the end of vector in each interaction of the realization.
